Project Name: Online course registration system
Description :
Recently, many colleges have moved from manual course registration process to web-based course
registration process that allows students to register for courses prescribed for that particular
semester. As more colleges follow this trend and begin to only offer online registration, it will
become increasingly important for these systems to be considered usable by all students. In
addition to the system being usable, it must also provide the student with convenient access to
information that will ease the course registering process.

The idea for the project was mostly motivated by the online registration system offered by many
other colleges. It seems unacceptable that large colleges would have a system that offers such a
low level of flexibility and lacks functionality to make the process easier for the students.
Combining our knowledge of other course registration systems, we came up with a list of features
that are important to an online course registration system.
